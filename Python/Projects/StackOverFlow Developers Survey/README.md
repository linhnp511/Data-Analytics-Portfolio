The enclosed data set is the full, cleaned results of the 2017 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Free response submissions and personally identifying information have been removed from the results to protect the privacy of respondents. There are three files besides this README:

1. survey_results_public.csv - CSV file with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer
2. survey_results_schema.csv - CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name
3. DeveloperSurvey2017QuestionaireCleaned.pdf - PDF file of survey instrument

The survey was fielded from January 12 to February 6, 2017, with responses sourced from Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange, and social media channels. Four-fifths of responses came from Stack Overflow or another Stack Exchange site. You can find the official published results here:

From the datasets, we try to answer 3 questions:

Question 1 - At what types of companies do developers get paid the most?
Question 2 - How does programming experience affect pay at different types of companies?
Question 3 - Does the ability to work remotely impact job satisfaction and salary?
