    "The number of ratings on WeRateDogs has had a general downward trend by month since the account was first started, going from a peak of almost 300 tweets in one month down to around 50 in the latest months. There was a sharp decline only a few months after the account was created. However, this does not necessarily mean that the number of overall posts by the account has decreased, as my analysis only focused on original content with images. It is possible that the account has focused on other areas of content, such as retweets, videos, and interactions with followers. \n",

    "There has been a steady upward trend in the average retweets and favorites since the account was first started, going from almost no interaction to around 35,000 retweets and favorites per post in the latest months. This trend is encouraging given that the account's original purpose was to post images with ratings.\n",
