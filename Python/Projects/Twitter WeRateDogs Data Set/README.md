[WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates?s=20) is a Twitter account that posts and rates pictures of dogs.

In my analysis, I want to answer the following questions:

- What is WeRateDogs's posting trend by month?
- What is the monthly trend of interactions with WeRateDogs's posts?
- What are the most popular dog breeds based on number of posts, interactions by Twitter users, and ratings?
- Is there any correlation between WeRateDogs's ratings and the interactions by Twitter users?

**In my project:**

- README.md (this file): Introduction of the project
- Folder [datasets](datasets): include raw initial datasets
- File [we_rate_dogs_project.ipynb](we_rate_dogs_project.ipynb): full code 
- Folder [graphs](graphs): include graphs extracted from [we_rate_dogs_project.ipynb](we_rate_dogs_project.ipynb) as png format 
- File [we_rate_dogs_report.ipynb](we_rate_dogs_report.ipynb): Summary of the project
