# Dataset Intro
WeRateDogs is a twitter account which share dog images and write a brief panegyric about the dog, then they let their followers to rate it by favoriting it. By asking WeRateDogs to share with us some of their tweets, they did. They have shared 5000+ of their tweets which contains some basic data. Sometimes in their brief panegyric they mention the breed of the dog, and some others they donâ€™t. But thanks to Udacity, they have performed some neutral network procedures to classify the dogs based on their images which are shared with the tweets.

The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

3 data sets

- twitter_archive_enhanced.csv ( download manually )

- image_predictions.tsv The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file (image_predictions.tsv) is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and the following URL: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv

- tweet_json.txt Each tweet's retweet count and favorite ("like") count at minimum, and any additional data you find interesting. Using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt file. Each tweet's JSON data should be written to its own line. Then read this .txt file line by line into a pandas DataFrame with (at minimum) tweet ID, retweet count, and favorite count. Note: do not include your Twitter API keys, secrets, and tokens in your project submission.
